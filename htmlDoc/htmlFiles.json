This includes, but is not limited to, business\r\n        strategies, financial data, technical processes, software, designs, research, and any other materials or\r\n        knowledge\r\n        that may give one party a competitive advantage. Confidential Information also includes information received\r\n        from\r\n        third parties under confidentiality obligations. Information that is publicly available, obtained through legal\r\n        means independent of this agreement, or required to be disclosed by law or a court order, is not considered\r\n        Confidential Information.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"section\">\r\n      <h2>III.

The Confidential Information should be protected\r\n        with\r\n        at least the same level of security and caution as each party applies to its own proprietary information, but no\r\n        less than a reasonable standard of care. Any disclosure of Confidential Information to employees, agents,\r\n        consultants, or subcontractors will only be permitted when absolutely necessary for the performance of the\r\n        agreement, and such individuals must be bound by confidentiality obligations equivalent to those in this\r\n        Agreement. Both parties will be held responsible for ensuring that these individuals adhere to the terms of this\r\n        Agreement.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"section\">\r\n      <h2>IV.

The notice must include details regarding the nature and extent of the breach. The\r\n        affected party reserves the right to pursue any and all legal remedies available, including but not limited to\r\n        seeking injunctive relief, specific performance, or damages for any losses incurred as a result of the breach.\r\n        The\r\n        breaching party shall be liable for any direct or indirect harm caused by the unauthorized disclosure or misuse\r\n        of\r\n        Confidential Information.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"section\">\r\n      <h2>V.

The return of materials must occur within a reasonable timeframe, or if requested,\r\n        such materials must be destroyed, with proof of destruction provided to the other party. This obligation to\r\n        return\r\n        or destroy materials containing Confidential Information applies even after the end of the relationship or the\r\n        termination of this Agreement, ensuring that no party retains access to sensitive information without\r\n        authorization.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"section\">\r\n      <h2>VI.

In such cases, the disclosing party must\r\n        promptly notify the other party to allow them the opportunity to seek protective measures or legal relief before\r\n        any disclosure is made. Unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information will result in immediate\r\n        legal\r\n        action and potential compensation for damages.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"section\">\r\n      <h2>VII.

Neither\r\n        party shall assign, transfer, or otherwise delegate any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the\r\n        prior written consent of the other party.

Competitive\r\n        activities\r\n        include, but are not limited to, acting as an owner, partner, or agent in such businesses, becoming an employee\r\n        of\r\n        a\r\n        competitor, or soliciting the Client’s customers for the benefit of a third party. In the event of a breach of\r\n        this\r\n        non-competition clause, the Client will issue a written notice requesting immediate compliance. If the\r\n        Consultant\r\n        fails to comply within thirty (30) days, they shall pay a penalty of {{terms.penalty}}.

Non-Waiver</h3>\r\n    <p>\r\n        The failure of either Party to enforce strict compliance with any provision of this Agreement shall not\r\n        constitute a waiver of that Party's right to subsequently enforce such provision or any other provision. No\r\n        waiver of any term, condition, or obligation of this Agreement shall be valid unless made in writing and signed\r\n        by the waiving Party.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>XIV.
