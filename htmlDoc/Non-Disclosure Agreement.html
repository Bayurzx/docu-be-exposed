        <h2>II. Obligations.</h2>

        <p>In consideration of the disclosure and release of Confidential Information by or on behalf of the Disclosing
            Party to the Receiving Party, the Receiving Party agrees to maintain the strictest confidentiality regarding
            all
            such Confidential Information as defined in this Non-Disclosure Agreement.</p>

            <u>{{purposeOfTheWork}}</u>.

        <!-- END_SECTION: Section_3 -->

        <!-- SECTION: {"key": "Section_4", "order": 8, "type": "legal", "hasVariables": false} -->


        <p>The Receiving Party shall take all necessary steps and measures to reduce the risk of disclosure,
            dissemination,
            or unauthorized use of the Confidential Information. This includes ensuring that only Representatives whose
            responsibilities require access to the Confidential Information are granted such access on a "need-to-know"
            basis. Before sharing any Confidential Information with these Representatives, the Receiving Party must
            obtain a
            written acknowledgment from them, affirming their agreement to adhere to all restrictive covenants and
            confidentiality obligations outlined in this Agreement. The Receiving Party remains accountable for any
            violations of this Agreement by its Representatives and must take all reasonable measures (including but not
            limited to legal action) to prevent such Representatives from engaging in unauthorized disclosure or use of
            the
            Confidential Information.</p>

        <p>The Receiving Party shall ensure that the Confidential Information is not copied or reproduced in any form
            whatsoever by itself, its Representatives, or any third parties without the explicit written consent of the
            Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that the ownership and copyright of the
            Confidential Information disclosed to it are vested in the Disclosing Party.</p>

        <p>The Receiving Party shall further ensure the security and control of any Confidential Information, whether in
            documentary or other tangible or intangible forms. This includes physically restricting access to such
            Confidential Information to secure areas within the Receiving Party's premises and storing it in a manner
            that
            prevents unauthorized access.</p>

            Disclosing Party's request at any time.</p>

        <p>The Receiving Party shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Representatives to, publish any press releases,
            make announcements, or issue any denials or confirmations in any medium regarding any information covered by
            this Agreement, without the explicit written consent of the Disclosing Party.</p>

        <p>At all times, it is understood that no liability for any breaches by the Company and/or its Representatives
            shall
            be attributed to the shareholders of the Company or any of its affiliated, related, associated, or

            <li>The Confidential Information is already publicly available at the time of disclosure;</li>
            <li>The Receiving Party was already aware of the information prior to its disclosure;</li>
            <li>The Receiving Party has lawfully obtained the Confidential Information from a third party not under any
                obligation or agreement with the Disclosing Party;</li>
            <li>The Confidential Information has been independently developed by the Receiving Party without reliance on
                the
                Disclosing Party's Confidential Information.</li>

        <h2>IV. Disclosure Due to Court Order/Governmental Action</h2>

        <p>If the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives is compelled to disclose any Confidential Information by
            court order or governmental directive, the Receiving Party shall immediately provide written notice to the
            Disclosing Party. This notice allows the Disclosing Party the opportunity to object to the disclosure and/or
            seek a protective order or other remedy. If the Disclosing Party cannot successfully object or obtain a
            remedy,
            the Receiving Party or its Representative(s) shall disclose only the Confidential Information required by
            the
            court order or directive and will make every effort to ensure confidential treatment of the disclosed
            information.</p>

            clients,
            partners, channels, programs, initiatives, and subsidiaries. The Receiving Party agrees not to bypass or
            undermine this relationship directly or indirectly with any third party without the Disclosing Party's
            written
            consent.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, the parties agree not to engage in direct or indirect competition with the other party’s
            clients,
            affiliates, or associated work engagements without prior written approval.</p>

        <h2>VI. Reporting Unauthorized Disclosure, Misappropriation, or Misuse of Confidential Information</h2>

        <p>The Receiving Party shall immediately notify the Disclosing Party of any unauthorized disclosure,
            misappropriation, or misuse of Confidential Information as soon as they become aware of such incidents.</p>

        <h2>VII. Term of the Agreement</h2>

        <p>For a period of five (5) years following the termination of this Agreement, both parties shall treat all
            information as confidential and take reasonable measures to prevent unauthorized disclosure. The parties
            shall
            ensure their employees, agents, and assistants understand and comply with the terms of this Agreement to
            uphold
            confidentiality.</p>

        <p>Upon the termination or completion of the Agreement, the Receiving Party shall promptly return or destroy all
            materials and documents containing Confidential Information, including summaries, copies, and excerpts
            stored in
            any format. The destruction must be verified in writing.</p>

        <h2>VIII. Return of Confidential Information</h2>

        <p>Upon the termination of this Agreement or at the request of the Disclosing Party, all Confidential
            Information
            disclosed under this Agreement shall be returned. Physical records, hardcopy materials, and other tangible
            forms
            of Confidential Information shall be delivered to the Disclosing Party. Digital records must be deleted with
            no
            copies retained by the Receiving Party.</p>

        <p>If delivery is not feasible, the parties may agree to destroy the Confidential Information. Such destruction
            must
            be certified in writing and witnessed by an authorized representative of the Disclosing Party or a duly
            authorized officer of the Receiving Party.</p>

        <h2>IX. Ownership</h2>

        <p>This Non-Disclosure Agreement is non-transferable and requires the written consent of both parties for any
            transfer.</p>

        <p>Each party retains exclusive ownership of its own Confidential Information, except as stated in the
            Exclusions
            from Confidential Information clause. No rights to the other party's Confidential Information, by license or
            otherwise, shall be granted without explicit consent. Any recommendations or contributions made by the
            Receiving

        <p>This Agreement represents the entire agreement between the Parties and overrides all previous agreements
            related
            to its subject matter.</p>

        <p>No modification of this Agreement will be valid unless it is documented in writing and signed by the Parties
            (or
            their authorized representatives).</p>

        <p>If any provision of this Agreement (or a portion of any provision) is determined by a court or other
            competent
            authority to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that provision or portion thereof shall, to the extent
            necessary, be considered as not forming part of this Agreement and shall be severed accordingly. The
            validity
            and enforceability of the remaining provisions will not be affected.</p>

            lead to irreparable consequences.</p>
