        <li>The Consultant shall strive to fulfill the obligations of this Agreement to the best of their ability.
          However, if the Client deems the service inadequate or unsatisfactory, the Consultant agrees not to seek any
          material or moral compensation, except for termination of the Agreement.</li>
        <li>Neither party shall transfer the rights or obligations established under this Agreement to any third-party

            <li>Suspend its obligations under this Agreement, and</li>
            <li>Immediately terminate the Agreement.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

          written consent of the Client, except where:
          <ul>
            <li>Mandatory notification to statutory bodies or governmental authorities is required by law.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The Consultant shall prevent the unauthorized dissemination of Confidential Information.</li>

      <!-- SECTION: {"key": "sections_8_9_10", "order": 9, "type": "legal", "hasVariables": true} -->
      <p><strong>8. Prohibition on Competition:</strong></p>
      <p>
        The Consultant acknowledges that the information provided by the
        Client represents unique and valuable assets. As such, the Consultant agrees that for a period of
        <strong>{{terms.duration}}</strong> years following the termination of this Agreement—whether voluntary or
        involuntary—they shall not engage directly or indirectly in any business competitive with the Client's. This
        restriction applies to the geographical area of <strong>{{consultant.geographical_area}}</strong>. Competitive
        activities
        include, but are not limited to, acting as an owner, partner, or agent in such businesses, becoming an employee
        of
        a
        competitor, or soliciting the Client’s customers for the benefit of a third party. In the event of a breach of
        this
        non-competition clause, the Client will issue a written notice requesting immediate compliance. If the
        Consultant
        fails to comply within thirty (30) days, they shall pay a penalty of {{terms.penalty}}. This
        penalty does not absolve the Consultant from their obligation to adhere to this clause.
      </p>

      <p><strong>9. Miscellaneous:</strong></p>
      <p>

        <em>Amendments:</em> Any amendments to this Agreement shall only be valid if made in writing and signed by both
        Parties.
        <em>Severability:</em> If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the remaining
        provisions shall remain valid and enforceable.
        <em>Governing Law and Dispute Resolution:</em> This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with
        the
        laws of <strong>{{terms.jurisdiction}}</strong>. Any disputes related to this Agreement, including questions of
        validity or termination, shall be resolved by the courts and execution offices of
        <strong>{{terms.jurisdiction}}</strong>.
        <em>Notifications:</em> All notifications under this Agreement must be in writing and delivered to the addresses
        specified herein. If a party’s address changes and the other party is not informed, notifications sent to the
        previously indicated address will be deemed legally valid.
        <em>Entire Agreement:</em> This Agreement represents the entire understanding between the Parties, superseding
        any
        prior written or oral agreements related to its subject matter.
