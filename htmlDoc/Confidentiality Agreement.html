      <h2>I. Recitals</h2>
      <p>
        WHEREAS, the Parties of this Agreement executed a contract named <span
          class="spacer">{{person_1.contract_name}}</span> on
        <span class="spacer">{{person_1.date}}</span>, and they wish to set forth the terms and conditions of their
        non-disclosure
        commitments via a separate agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under this Agreement, the parties are referred to individually as "Disclosing Party" or "Receiving Party,"
        depending on their role in disclosing or receiving confidential information.

      <h2>II. Confidential Information</h2>
      <p>
        "Confidential Information" refers to all proprietary, non-public, or sensitive information shared between the
        parties during the course of their commercial relationship. This includes, but is not limited to, business
        strategies, financial data, technical processes, software, designs, research, and any other materials or
        knowledge
        that may give one party a competitive advantage. Confidential Information also includes information received
        from
        third parties under confidentiality obligations. Information that is publicly available, obtained through legal
        means independent of this agreement, or required to be disclosed by law or a court order, is not considered
        Confidential Information.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>III. Protection of Confidential Information</h2>
      <p>
        Both parties agree to exercise the utmost care in safeguarding Confidential Information and to take all
        reasonable
        measures to prevent unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. The Confidential Information should be protected
        with
        at least the same level of security and caution as each party applies to its own proprietary information, but no
        less than a reasonable standard of care. Any disclosure of Confidential Information to employees, agents,
        consultants, or subcontractors will only be permitted when absolutely necessary for the performance of the
        agreement, and such individuals must be bound by confidentiality obligations equivalent to those in this
        Agreement. Both parties will be held responsible for ensuring that these individuals adhere to the terms of this
        Agreement.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>IV. Violation of this Agreement</h2>
      <p>
        In the event of a violation or breach of this Agreement, the party aware of the breach must promptly notify the
        other party in writing. The notice must include details regarding the nature and extent of the breach. The
        affected party reserves the right to pursue any and all legal remedies available, including but not limited to
        seeking injunctive relief, specific performance, or damages for any losses incurred as a result of the breach.
        The
        breaching party shall be liable for any direct or indirect harm caused by the unauthorized disclosure or misuse
        of
        Confidential Information.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>V. Return of Materials Containing Confidential Information</h2>
      <p>
        Upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement or the commercial relationship, each party is obligated to
        return all materials, documents, files, or any other items containing Confidential Information, whether in
        physical or electronic form. The return of materials must occur within a reasonable timeframe, or if requested,
        such materials must be destroyed, with proof of destruction provided to the other party. This obligation to
        return
        or destroy materials containing Confidential Information applies even after the end of the relationship or the
        termination of this Agreement, ensuring that no party retains access to sensitive information without
        authorization.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>VI. Disclosure of Confidential Information</h2>
      <p>
        Disclosure of Confidential Information to any third party, or the use of such information for any purpose not
        expressly authorized by this Agreement, is strictly prohibited. No party shall disclose any part of the
        Confidential Information to any individual, entity, or organization without obtaining prior written consent from
        the other party, except when required by law or governmental order. In such cases, the disclosing party must
        promptly notify the other party to allow them the opportunity to seek protective measures or legal relief before
        any disclosure is made. Unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information will result in immediate
        legal
        action and potential compensation for damages.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>VII. Term and Assignment</h2>
      <p>
        This Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated by mutual written consent of both parties. The
        confidentiality obligations outlined herein shall continue indefinitely, even after the termination of the
        Agreement, the cessation of the business relationship, or the return of all Confidential Information. Neither
        party shall assign, transfer, or otherwise delegate any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the
        prior written consent of the other party. Any unauthorized assignment or transfer will be considered a material
        breach of this Agreement.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>VIII. Partial Invalidity</h2>
      <p>
        In the event that any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court
        or
        competent authority, the remaining provisions shall continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent
        permitted by law. The invalid or unenforceable provision will be replaced with a valid provision that most
        closely
        reflects the original intent of the parties, while maintaining the balance of rights and obligations under the
        Agreement.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>IX. Amendment</h2>
      <p>
        Any amendments or modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by authorized
        representatives
        of both parties. No oral agreements or understandings will be considered binding unless confirmed in writing.
        The
        written amendment will become part of this Agreement and will supersede any previous provisions that are
        inconsistent with the new terms.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>X. Notifications</h2>
      <p>
        All notifications under this Agreement must be made in writing and delivered either in person, by courier, by
        registered mail, or via email with read receipt confirmation. Each party shall provide the other with their
        current contact information, including physical and email addresses, for the purpose of receiving notifications.
        Notifications are deemed effective on the date of delivery, provided they are sent to the appropriate address as
        specified in this Agreement.
