        <!-- SECTION: {"key": "Section_5_14", "order": 6, "type": "legal", "hasVariables": false} -->
        <h3>V. Intellectual Property</h3>
        <p>Intellectual Property refers to any intangible creations of the mind, such as artistic or literary works, designs, images, names (including trade names), trademarks, logos, symbols, patents, copyrights, designs, architecture, concepts, and other items used in commerce. As outlined in this Agreement, the Client's use of the Intellectual Property will not be restricted in any way. Any Intellectual Property acquired by the Contractor during the term of this Agreement shall only be used for the purposes of fulfilling this Agreement.

        <h3>VI. No Employer-Employee Relationship</h3>
        <p>The Parties acknowledge that this Agreement does not create an employer-employee relationship. Both Parties are independent contractors, and this Agreement does not form a partnership or joint venture but is solely a contract for service. The Client is not responsible for paying or contributing to the Contractor's social security, taxes, unemployment, workers' compensation, insurance premiums, or any other benefits provided to the Client’s employees.</p>
        
        <h3>VII. Return of Client's Property</h3>

Any digital or electronic data may be deleted upon the Client’s request, or physical records may be destroyed at the Client's request if returning such documents or data containing confidential information is not possible.</p>
        

    <h3>VIII. Indemnification</h3>
    <p>
        Subject to any breach provisions herein, each Party agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other
        Party, including its agents, affiliates, officers, and employees, from and against any claims, losses, damages,
        penalties, liabilities, and expenses of any nature arising from or in connection with any acts or omissions in
        the performance of this Agreement. Such indemnification obligation shall survive the termination or expiration
        of this Agreement.
    </p>

    <h3>IX. Amendments</h3>
    <p>
        Any modifications, amendments, or alterations to this Agreement shall have no force or effect unless made in
        writing and executed by both Parties. Oral amendments or modifications shall have no binding effect.
    </p>

    <h3>X. Time of Essence</h3>
    <p>
        Time is of the essence in the performance of all duties and obligations under this Agreement. All deadlines and
        schedules established herein shall be strictly adhered to, and no extensions shall be granted without proper
        justification and mutual written consent of both Parties.
    </p>

    <h3>XI. Assignment</h3>
    <p>
        The Contractor shall not assign, delegate, subcontract, or transfer any duties, rights, or responsibilities
        outlined in this Agreement to any third party without first obtaining express written consent from the Client.
        Any unauthorized assignment shall be void and constitute a material breach of this Agreement.
    </p>

    <h3>XII. Severability</h3>
    <p>
        Should any provision of this Agreement be deemed invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction,
        such invalidity shall be limited to the specific provision in question, and all other provisions shall remain in
        full force and effect. The invalid provision shall be modified or reformed to the extent necessary to make it
        valid and enforceable while preserving its intent.
    </p>

    <h3>XIII. Non-Waiver</h3>
    <p>
        The failure of either Party to enforce strict compliance with any provision of this Agreement shall not
        constitute a waiver of that Party's right to subsequently enforce such provision or any other provision. No
        waiver of any term, condition, or obligation of this Agreement shall be valid unless made in writing and signed
        by the waiving Party.
    </p>

    <h3>XIV. Entire Agreement</h3>
    <p>
        This Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive statement of understanding between the Parties,
        superseding all prior or contemporaneous proposals, communications, and agreements, whether oral or written,
        relating to the subject matter hereof. No representations, understandings, agreements, warranties, or conditions
        shall affect or modify the terms herein unless expressly stated in this Agreement.
