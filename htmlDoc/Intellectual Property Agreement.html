    <p>The Company and the Owner shall be individually referred to as "Party" and collectively referred to as the
        "Parties".</p>

    <p>WHEREAS, the Owner is the employee of the Company in the position of {{owner.position}};</p>

    <p>WHEREAS, the Owner agrees and undertakes to transfer intellectual property rights and related interests of its
        original work, designs and other work created during the Owner's employment to the Company under the term and
        conditions of this Agreement;</p>

    <p>NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, the Parties agree as follows;</p>

    <h3>II. Subject and Scope of the Agreement</h3>

    <p>This Agreement governs the determination of all patent and utility model applications pertaining to inventions
        and materials that may be subject to intellectual property rights, which arise within the scope of the
        {{projectName}} Project. This project has been developed by the Owner, and this Agreement establishes the rights
        and obligations of all parties regarding the industrial application and commercialization of the invention.</p>

    <p>Any services that may be provided by the Owner to future transferees or licensees following the transfer or
        licensing of the subject matter, including services related to patents or utility models connected to the
        invention, are explicitly excluded from this Agreement's scope. Any fees associated with such services are also

    <h4>The Owner's Obligations:</h4>
    <p>1. Shall provide the Company with comprehensive documentation, including all technical specifications and
        information regarding the developed invention, whether patentable or not, in their capacity as the "inventor" as
        defined by relevant legislation.</p>

    <p>2. Acknowledges and agrees that the Company will be the applicant for all domestic and international registration
        applications.</p>

    <p>3. Commits to providing essential technical information for patent application preparation, including claims,
        figures, and summaries. The Owner will collaborate with designated personnel and assist in document preparation
        as needed.</p>

    <p>4. Shall maintain confidentiality regarding the invention and will not disclose information to third parties
        without the Company's written consent. The Owner will refrain from any actions that could compromise the
        parties' rights under this Agreement.</p>

        without the Owner's written consent. The Company will refrain from any actions that could compromise the
        parties' rights under this Agreement.</p>

    <p>2. Will manage all legal procedures to protect the Owner's rights, including signing necessary documentation for
        patent/utility model applications and commercialization stages, and will keep the Owner informed of relevant
        developments.</p>

    <h3>IV. General Provisions</h3>
    <p>Commercial decisions regarding patent commercialization require written consent from both Parties. If either
        Party suspects a violation of patent/utility model rights by third parties, they must promptly notify the other
        Party. The Company will take necessary legal measures at its expense.</p>

    <p>In cases of third-party rights infringement during patent use, licensing, or commercialization, liability is
        shared jointly between the parties.</p>

    <h3>V. Term of Agreement</h3>
    <p>This Agreement shall remain effective throughout the duration of the patent protection period unless terminated
        according to the Agreement's termination provisions.</p>

    <h3>VI. Termination</h3>
    <p>The Parties may terminate this Agreement at any time through mutual written consent and agreement on termination
        consequences.</p>

    <p>If either Party fails to meet their obligations and does not remedy the situation within the specified notice
        period, or if irreparable damage occurs, the affected Party may terminate this Agreement bilaterally.</p>
